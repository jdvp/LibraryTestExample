# LibTestingExample
Project to show example of how to run Firebase Test Lab tests for
a library. Typically, since Firebase Test Lab requires 2 separate apk/aab
files for upload, you would be unable to upload the library's aar + test apk.
Further Test Lab also requires that both apk files have different package
names so you can't upload the test apk twice.
